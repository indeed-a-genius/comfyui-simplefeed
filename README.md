# ComfyUI SimpleFeed

A simple, configurable, and extensible image feed module for ComfyUI. Originally proposed as a pull request to [ComfyUI Custom Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts), it was set aside due to the scale of the changes. This module can operate alongside the original, offering no additional functionality; uninstall it if you prefer the original.

## Configuration Options

### Settings
- **Visibility and Position:** Control the image feed's visibility and location.
- **Image Count Limit:** Limit the number of images displayed.
- **Sort Order:** Sort images by generation time, from oldest to newest or vice versa.

### Menu Options
- **Node Filter Button:** Filter which nodes contribute images to the feed, managing duplicates. All images are included when the filter is off.
- **Clear Button:** Remove all images from the tray without deleting them from your filesystem.

### Lightbox Guide
- **Dynamic Updating:** Integrates new images as they're generated.
- **Navigation Arrows:** Color-coded for functionality:
  - **Black:** Inactive when only a single image is present.
  - **Grey:** Navigate between images.
  - **Orange:** Indicates the end of the feed; wraps to the start.
